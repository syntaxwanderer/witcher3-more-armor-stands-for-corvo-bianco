# The Best Way to Play The Witcher 3
(Nexusmods)[https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11381]

There is one sad moment in The Witcher 3 — the moment when everything suddenly ends. Luckily it is a game, so you can always start again. But the game almost pushes us into the classic order: main story, Hearts of Stone, and only after that Blood and Wine. Enemy levels clearly point to this.
But come on. Getting your own house in Toussaint with all its bonuses and then finishing the game? That feels unfair.

So here is a strategy that lets you get Corvo Bianco while almost the whole adventure is still ahead. It makes the game fresher, more exciting and more emotional.
Why New Game Plus Is a MustNew Game Plus is amazing. After your first playthrough you already understand the world, how choices work and what consequences they bring. In NG+ you start with a good level and proper upgrades, so you can finally play the way you want.
My Tips

### Step 1
Don’t play on low difficulty. Deathmarch sounds scary, but it is not as hard as it seems. The worst thing that will happen is that you will finally read the bestiary and learn how to use oils, bombs and potions. And it is really worth it.

### Step 2
Use your first playthrough to try different story paths.
If you chose Yennefer before, choose Triss.
If you let Gaunter O’Dimm destroy Olgierd, try the other option.
If you ended up in the Toussaint prison, enjoy it — even there the game gives strong emotional moments.
And in New Game Plus you can create your perfect playthrough.

### Step 3
Follow the main story until you free Dandelion (the quest following Ciri’s trail). After you rescue this noble troublemaker, the road to Toussaint becomes open.

### Step 4
Entering Toussaint means four challenges. If you are new to the game, they may surprise you.


### The bandits with Palmerin.
Not too hard, but they can hit you well. Use Quen, bombs, oils and a bit of luck.
The Golyat.
The trick is simple — aim for the eye. If you haven’t done it before, now is the time. You even get an achievement.
Drowners and the Bruxa in Corvo Bianco.
Drowners are annoying, but the real challenge is the bruxa. If you don’t know her weaknesses, she will show you what “you are wrong” really means.
Black Blood, Aard and Yrden — and the fight lasts ten seconds. You cannot out-click her.
Shaelmaar.
The last guardian on your way. After that you will run after a unicorn, dive for some fish and complete a few simple tasks — and finally you get the keys to Corvo Bianco.

Why You Should Do All This EarlyBecause after you get Corvo Bianco, almost the whole game is still ahead of you.

And this mod becomes incredibly useful.

- You get a proper place to store items instead of throwing everything into one messy chest.
- A place to rest before big fights — the bed gives nice bonuses.
- A basement alchemy lab.
- A workshop to sharpen swords.
- A way to recycle mutagens.

And one more secret bonus — Corvo Bianco grants a new special ability. Don’t miss the letter delivered by the little boy in Toussaint.
Final WordsGood luck on your new playthrough. I’m sure this strategy and the mod will make your experience unforgettable.
